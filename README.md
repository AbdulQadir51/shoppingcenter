# Redux ShoppingCenter


## Description

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform. I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API, so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state when I review the appâ€™s store it has following features:
It uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
I can review the way the React front end accesses the store
The app uses a Redux provider
The app determines changes to its global state
The app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
The app extracts state data from the store
The app uses Redux instead of the Context API
The app dispatches actions
The app uses Redux instead of the Context API
