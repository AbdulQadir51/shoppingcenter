## Description

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform. I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API, so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state when I review the appâ€™s store. 

It has following features:

- It uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
- It can review the way the React front end accesses the store
- The app uses a Redux provider
- The app determines changes to its global state
- The app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
- The app extracts state data from the store
- The app uses Redux instead of the Context API
- The app dispatches actions
- The app uses Redux instead of the Context API
